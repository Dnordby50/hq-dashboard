## [2026-04-25 23:03] ARM 2 v1: customer color picker + signature wired
By: Claude Code
Changed: Customer portal (?portal=token mode in index.html) now lets epoxy customers pick one or more labeled flake colors from the 15 seeded Simiron swatches before signing. Signature submit now sends the picks to portal_confirm_job (was previously sending p_colors: null). Paint jobs skip the picker and just collect a signature with copy explaining the project manager handles paint colors directly. Portal mode now overrides the dark dashboard CSS variables to render on the light/professional palette (--rd-bg, --rd-card, etc) and applies an FTP brand class for orange accent on Finishing Touch customers.
Why: ARM 2 backend (Supabase schema, RPCs, DripJobs webhooks) was already live and the index.html portal scaffold was already drawn, but customers had no way to actually choose their colors through the portal. Locking colors via customer self-service before the crew shows up is the operationally critical gap.
Files touched: index.html
Next steps: Test end-to-end with a real DripJobs-generated token. After v1 validates, follow up with reviews + referrals (already drawn but dormant), per-brand visual polish, paint color seed for Sherwin-Williams, and DripJobs auto-send of the portal link.
Handoff to Cowork: None
Handoff to Dylan: 1) Pull a portal link from a recent customer in the Prescott CRM tab and open it in a private window to verify the picker shows 15 Simiron swatches, the signature canvas works, and the confirm button enables only after both a pick AND signature exist. 2) Test on a phone (iOS Safari + Android Chrome) since signature canvas is the highest failure-risk piece. 3) Push to origin when ready (this commit is unpushed).

## [2026-04-25 22:39] Removed TEST-HANDOFF.md after loop verified
By: Claude Code
Changed: Deleted TEST-HANDOFF.md from the repo.
Why: The handoff loop test (entries on 2026-04-25 22:36 and 23:00) succeeded and Cowork's commit 7d6af8f confirmed the trace. The file has no purpose beyond that test.
Files touched: TEST-HANDOFF.md
Next steps: None. Loop is closed.
Handoff to Cowork: None
Handoff to Dylan: Push main to origin when ready (local is currently ahead by 3 commits, plus this one makes 4).

## [2026-04-25 23:00] Cowork handoff confirmation
By: Cowork
Changed: Appended the line "Cowork was here" to the bottom of TEST-HANDOFF.md as requested in the handoff.
Why: Closes the end-to-end test of the Claude Code, Cowork, Dylan handoff loop. Leaves a verifiable trace that Cowork picked up the written handoff and acted on it.
Files touched: TEST-HANDOFF.md
Next steps: Commit with message "test: cowork handoff confirmation". Dylan can verify the loop and then schedule a future cleanup entry to delete TEST-HANDOFF.md.
Handoff to Cowork: None
Handoff to Dylan: Verify the commit landed, then decide when to remove TEST-HANDOFF.md.

## [2026-04-25 22:36] Test handoff file created for Cowork
By: Claude Code
Changed: Created TEST-HANDOFF.md containing a single handoff request asking Cowork to append the line "Cowork was here" to that file.
Why: End-to-end test of the Claude Code, Cowork, Dylan handoff loop. Confirms Cowork reads handoffs from this repo, acts on them, and leaves a verifiable trace.
Files touched: TEST-HANDOFF.md
Next steps: Wait for Cowork to append the line and commit. Once verified, the file can be deleted in a future cleanup entry.
Handoff to Cowork: Open TEST-HANDOFF.md, append the line "Cowork was here" to the bottom, then commit with message "test: cowork handoff confirmation".
Handoff to Dylan: None

## [2026-04-25 22:34] Project log initialized
By: Claude Code
Changed: Created CLAUDE.md and PROJECT-LOG.md. Initialized git repo and .gitignore.
Why: Establish change history so Dylan, Cowork, and Claude Code stay in sync and Dylan can debug or roll back when something breaks.
Files touched: CLAUDE.md, PROJECT-LOG.md, .gitignore
Next steps: Begin tracking all future changes via commits and log entries.
Handoff to Cowork: None
Handoff to Dylan: Going forward, before each Claude Code session, cd into this directory so CLAUDE.md is loaded automatically.
