## [2026-04-25 22:36] Test handoff file created for Cowork
By: Claude Code
Changed: Created TEST-HANDOFF.md containing a single handoff request asking Cowork to append the line "Cowork was here" to that file.
Why: End-to-end test of the Claude Code, Cowork, Dylan handoff loop. Confirms Cowork reads handoffs from this repo, acts on them, and leaves a verifiable trace.
Files touched: TEST-HANDOFF.md
Next steps: Wait for Cowork to append the line and commit. Once verified, the file can be deleted in a future cleanup entry.
Handoff to Cowork: Open TEST-HANDOFF.md, append the line "Cowork was here" to the bottom, then commit with message "test: cowork handoff confirmation".
Handoff to Dylan: None

## [2026-04-25 22:34] Project log initialized
By: Claude Code
Changed: Created CLAUDE.md and PROJECT-LOG.md. Initialized git repo and .gitignore.
Why: Establish change history so Dylan, Cowork, and Claude Code stay in sync and Dylan can debug or roll back when something breaks.
Files touched: CLAUDE.md, PROJECT-LOG.md, .gitignore
Next steps: Begin tracking all future changes via commits and log entries.
Handoff to Cowork: None
Handoff to Dylan: Going forward, before each Claude Code session, cd into this directory so CLAUDE.md is loaded automatically.
